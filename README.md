# [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform) Library

This is a template for a [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform#readme) **library** targeting desktop,
Android, and iOS. It is built on top of the [Compose Multiplatform Template](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-template)
and contains the following changes:
* Add a `lib` module for the shared library code.
* Move the androidApp, desktopApp, and iosApp modules to the `samples` folder.
* Apply the `org.jetbrains.dokka` plugin to generate documentation for the library code.
* Set up a GitHub Action to publish the documentation to GitHub Pages.
* Apply the `com.vanniktech.maven.publish` plugin to streamline the process of publishing a library.

## Maven Publish
This template applies the `com.vanniktech.maven.publish` plugin to streamline the process of publishing a library.

### Configuring
To publish your library properly, you need to configure the necessary information in `mavenPublishing` block in `build.gradle.kts`
```kotlin
mavenPublishing {
    // publishToMavenCentral(SonatypeHost.DEFAULT)
    // or when publishing to https://s01.oss.sonatype.org
    publishToMavenCentral(SonatypeHost.S01, automaticRelease = true)
    signAllPublications()
    coordinates("com.example.mylibrary", "mylibrary-runtime", "1.0.0")

    pom {
        name.set(project.name)
        description.set("A description of what my library does.")
        inceptionYear.set("2023")
        url.set("https://github.com/username/mylibrary/")
        licenses {
            license {
                name.set("The Apache License, Version 2.0")
                url.set("http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt")
                distribution.set("http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt")
            }
        }
        developers {
            developer {
                id.set("username")
                name.set("User Name")
                url.set("https://github.com/username/")
            }
        }
        scm {
            url.set("https://github.com/username/mylibrary/")
            connection.set("scm:git:git://github.com/username/mylibrary.git")
            developerConnection.set("scm:git:ssh://git@github.com/username/mylibrary.git")
        }
    }
}
```

### Secrets
For the publishing to work the credentials for Sonatype OSS as well as for the GPG key that is used for signing need to provided. To keep them out of version control it is recommended to either put this into the gradle.properties file user home or to use environment variables for publishing from CI servers.
```kotlin
mavenCentralUsername=username
mavenCentralPassword=the_password

signing.keyId=12345678
signing.password=some_password
signing.secretKeyRingFile=/Users/yourusername/.gnupg/secring.gpg
```

Please visit https://vanniktech.github.io/gradle-maven-publish-plugin/central/#configuring-maven-central for detailed instructions.

## KtLint

This template applies the `org.jlleitschuh.gradle.ktlint` plugin to enforce the code style. 
To check the code style, run the following command:
```shell
./gradlew ktlintCheck
```
To automatically fix the code style, run the following command:
```shell
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```

This template also setup the git hooks to fix the code style before committing automatically.
To install the git hooks, run the following command:
```shell
./gradlew setUpGitHooks
```
Then you can commit the code without worrying about the code style.

## Dokka

This template applies the `org.jetbrains.dokka` plugin to generate documentation for the library code.
To generate the documentation, run the following command:
```shell
./gradlew dokkaHtmlMultiModule
```
The documentation will be generated in the `build/dokka/htmlMultiModule` folder.


## Set up the environment

> **Note**
> The iOS part of Compose Multiplatform is in Alpha. It may change incompatibly and require manual migration in the
> future.
> If you have any issues, please report them on [GitHub](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/issues).

You can use this template to start developing your
own [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform#readme) library targeting desktop,
Android, and iOS.
Follow our tutorial below to get your first Compose Multiplatform app up and running.
The result will be a [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) project that uses the
Compose Multiplatform UI framework.

<img src="readme_images/banner.png" height="350">


> **Warning**
> You need a Mac with macOS to write and run iOS-specific code on simulated or real devices.
> This is an Apple requirement.

To work with this template, you need the following:

* A machine running a recent version of macOS
* [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* The [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile)
* The [CocoaPods dependency manager](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-cocoapods.html)

### Check your environment

Before you start, use the [KDoctor](https://github.com/Kotlin/kdoctor) tool to ensure that your development environment
is configured correctly:

1. Install KDoctor with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    ```text
    brew install kdoctor
    ```

2. Run KDoctor in your terminal:

    ```text
    kdoctor
    ```

   If everything is set up correctly, you'll see valid output:

   ```text
   Environment diagnose (to see all details, use -v option):
   [✓] Operation System
   [✓] Java
   [✓] Android Studio
   [✓] Xcode
   [✓] Cocoapods
   
   Conclusion:
     ✓ Your system is ready for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile development!
   ```

Otherwise, KDoctor will highlight which parts of your setup still need to be configured and will suggest a way to fix
them.

## Examine the project structure

Open the project in Android Studio and switch the view from **Android** to **Project** to see all the files and targets
belonging to the project:

<img src="readme_images/open_project_view.png" height="300px">

Your Compose Multiplatform project includes 4 modules:

### `shared`

This is a Kotlin module that contains the logic common for desktop, Android, and iOS applications, that is, the code you
share between platforms.

This `shared` module is also where you'll write your Compose Multiplatform code.
In `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/App.kt`, you can find the shared root `@Composable` function for your app.

It uses Gradle as the build system. You can add dependencies and change settings in `shared/build.gradle.kts`.
The `shared` module builds into a Java library, an Android library, and an iOS framework.

### `desktopApp`

This is a Kotlin module that builds into a desktop application. It uses Gradle as the build system. The `desktopApp`
module depends on and uses the `shared` module as a regular library.

### `androidApp`

This is a Kotlin module that builds into an Android application. It uses Gradle as the build system.
The `androidApp` module depends on and uses the `shared` module as a regular Android library.

### `iosApp`

This is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application.
It depends on and uses the `shared` module as a CocoaPods dependency.

## Run your application

### On desktop

To run your desktop application in Android Studio, select `desktopApp` in the list of run configurations and click **Run**:

<img src="readme_images/run_on_desktop.png" height="60px"><br />

<img src="readme_images/desktop_app_running.png" height="300px">

You can also run Gradle tasks in the terminal:

* `./gradlew run` to run application
* `./gradlew package` to store native distribution into `build/compose/binaries`

### On Android

To run your application on an Android emulator:

1. Ensure you have an Android virtual device available.
   Otherwise, [create one](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd).
2. In the list of run configurations, select `androidApp`.
3. Choose your virtual device and click **Run**:

    <img src="readme_images/run_on_android.png" height="60px"><br />      

    <img src="readme_images/android_app_running.png" height="300px">

<details>
  <summary>Alternatively, use Gradle</summary>

To install an Android application on a real Android device or an emulator, run `./gradlew installDebug` in the terminal.

</details>

### On iOS

#### Running on a simulator

To run your application on an iOS simulator in Android Studio, modify the `iosApp` run configuration:

1. In the list of run configurations, select **Edit Configurations**:

   <img src="readme_images/edit_run_config.png" height="200px">

2. Navigate to **iOS Application** | **iosApp**.
3. In the **Execution target** list, select your target device. Click **OK**:

   <img src="readme_images/target_device.png" height="400px">

4. The `iosApp` run configuration is now available. Click **Run** next to your virtual device:

   <img src="readme_images/ios_app_running.png" height="300px">

#### Running on a real iOS device

You can run your Compose Multiplatform application on a real iOS device for free.
To do so, you'll need the following:

* The `TEAM_ID` associated with your [Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204316)
* The iOS device registered in Xcode

> **Note**
> Before you continue, we suggest creating a simple "Hello, world!" project in Xcode to ensure you can successfully run
> apps on your device.
> You can follow the instructions below or watch
> this [Stanford CS193P lecture recording](https://youtu.be/bqu6BquVi2M?start=716&end=1399).

<details>
<summary>How to create and run a simple project in Xcode</summary>

1. On the Xcode welcome screen, select **Create a new project in Xcode**.
2. On the **iOS** tab, choose the **App** template. Click **Next**.
3. Specify the product name and keep other settings default. Click **Next**.
4. Select where to store the project on your computer and click **Create**. You'll see an app that displays "Hello,
   world!" on the device screen.
5. At the top of your Xcode screen, click on the device name near the **Run** button.
6. Plug your device into the computer. You'll see this device in the list of run options.
7. Choose your device and click **Run**.

</details>

##### Finding your Team ID

In the terminal, run `kdoctor --team-ids` to find your Team ID.
KDoctor will list all Team IDs currently configured on your system, for example:

```text
3ABC246XYZ (Max Sample)
ZABCW6SXYZ (SampleTech Inc.)
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative way to find your Team ID</summary>

If KDoctor doesn't work for you, try this alternative method:

1. In Android Studio, run the `iosApp` configuration with the selected real device. The build should fail.
2. Go to Xcode and select **Open a project or file**.
3. Navigate to the `iosApp/iosApp.xcworkspace` file of your project.
4. In the left-hand menu, select `iosApp`.
5. Navigate to **Signing & Capabilities**.
6. In the **Team** list, select your team.

If you haven't set up your team yet, use the **Add account** option and follow the steps.

</details>

To run the application, set the `TEAM_ID`:

1. In the template, navigate to the `iosApp/Configuration/Config.xcconfig` file.
2. Set your `TEAM_ID`.
3. Re-open the project in Android Studio. It should show the registered iOS device in the `iosApp` run configuration.

## Make your first changes

You can now make some changes in the code and check that they are visible in both the iOS and Android applications at
the same time:

1. In Android Studio, navigate to the `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/App.kt` file.
   This is the common entry point for your Compose Multiplatform app.

   Here, you see the code responsible for rendering the "Hello, World!" button and the animated Compose Multiplatform logo:
   
   ```kotlin
   @OptIn(ExperimentalResourceApi::class)
   @Composable
   internal fun App() {
       MaterialTheme {
           var greetingText by remember { mutableStateOf("Hello, World!") }
           var showImage by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
           Column(Modifier.fillMaxWidth(), horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally) {
               Button(onClick = {
                   greetingText = "Hello, ${getPlatformName()}"
                   showImage = !showImage
               }) {
                   Text(greetingText)
               }
               AnimatedVisibility(showImage) {
                   Image(
                       painterResource("compose-multiplatform.xml"),
                       null
                   )
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. Update the shared code by adding a text field that will update the name displayed on the button:

   ```diff
   @OptIn(ExperimentalResourceApi::class)
   @Composable
   internal fun App() {
       MaterialTheme {
           var greetingText by remember { mutableStateOf("Hello, World!") }
           var showImage by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
           Column(Modifier.fillMaxWidth(), horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally) {
               Button(onClick = {
                   greetingText = "Hello, ${getPlatformName()}"
                   showImage = !showImage
               }) {
                   Text(greetingText)
               }
   +           TextField(greetingText, onValueChange = { greetingText = it })
               AnimatedVisibility(showImage) {
                   Image(
                       painterResource("compose-multiplatform.xml"),
                       null
                   )
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. Re-run the `desktopApp`, `androidApp`, and `iosApp` configurations. You'll see this change reflected in all three
   apps:

   <img src="readme_images/text_field_added.png" height="350px">

## How to configure the iOS application

To get a better understanding of this template's setup and learn how to configure the basic properties of your iOS app without Xcode,
open the `iosApp/Configuration/Config.xcconfig` file in Android Studio. The configuration file contains:

* `APP_NAME`, a target executable and an application bundle name.
* `BUNDLE_ID`,
  which [uniquely identifies the app throughout the system](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleidentifier#discussion).
* `TEAM_ID`, [a unique identifier generated by Apple that's assigned to your team](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-your-team/locate-your-team-id/#:~:text=A%20Team%20ID%20is%20a,developer%20in%20App%20Store%20Connect).

To configure the `APP_NAME` option, open `Config.xcconfig` in any text editor *before opening* the project in Android
Studio, and then set the desired name.

If you need to change this option after you open the project in Android Studio, do the following:

1. Close the project in Android Studio.
2. Run `./cleanup.sh` in your terminal.
3. Change the setting.
4. Open the project in Android Studio again.

To configure advanced settings, use Xcode. After opening the project in Android Studio,
open the `iosApp/iosApp.xcworkspace` file in Xcode and make changes there.
